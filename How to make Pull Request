<To pull>
You need to make a pull request for your code (not push).
By creating a pull request, you are notifying collaborators about your changes or work

here are the steps to send a pull request on GitHub:

1. Fork: Fork the original repository of the project to your GitHub account.

2. Clone: Clone the forked repository to your local machine to work on it locally.

3. git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git
Create Branch: Create a new branch for the new feature or changes you want to make.

4. git checkout -b feature-branch
Work Locally: Make changes and additions to the code on your local branch.

5. Commit: Save your changes to the local repository.

6. git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push to Fork: Push your changes to your forked repository.

7. git push origin feature-branch
Create Pull Request: Go back to the GitHub website, navigate to your forked repository, and create a pull request by clicking the "Compare & pull request" button. Review the changes and provide a description.

8. Review: The project owner or collaborators will review your pull request and decide whether to merge it.

9. Merge: Once the review is complete, the owner can merge the pull request, and your changes will be reflected in the original repository.
