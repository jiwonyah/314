<Database>
I did not use MySql but used ORM with H2 console.
If you want to deal with db, follow the steps.

1. Go to C Drive ---> Users --> [Username]
2. Create a file named test.mv.db (mv.db is extension. it is a db file)
3. check if the created file is 0 byte.
4. Turn on the server (the method depends on your IDE. I'm using STS)
5. Go to 'http://localhost:8080/h2-console' via browser
6. Press Connect button
7. Now can manage db
