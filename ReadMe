## Which foler you have to check: /myproject/csit314
There are all backend code and combined frontend code. (For frontend code, only files in named folder works. Rest of them are just for backup. You can ignore them.)

## What have done:
**review**
- [x]  AgentViewReviewController.py
    - [x]  viewReviewList.html
    - [x]  reviewDetailPage.html
- [ ]  BuyerSellerWriteReviewController.py ()
    - [x]  agentListPage.html
    - [ ]  writeReviewForm.html

**favourite**
- [x]  SaveFavouriteController.py
- [x]  SellerViewSaveCountController.py
- [x]  ViewSavedFavouriteController.py
    - [x]  viewSavedFavouriteBoundary.html

**mortgage**
- [x]  BuyerCalculateMortgageController.py
    - [x]  calculateMortgage.html


## What should be done:
* BuyerSellerWriteReviewController.py: Need to fix redirect code. (`return redirect(url_for('write_review_controller.agent_list_index'))`)
* Apply CSS for property listing. -> ViewShortlistPage accordingly

All the code I've posted is functional. If it doesn't work, please check your settings. Especially, don't forget to add the blueprint to `app.py`. Also, update the database.
